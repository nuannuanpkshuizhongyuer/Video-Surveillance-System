Intelligent Collaborative Surveillance System
=========================
Face Detection, Face Recognition and Motion Tracking in Surveillance Video


In this project a new model of surveillance is proposed where multiple cameras are used which work together in a collaborative manner such that effective streams are fewer 
needing less human attention and support. 

The project has two modules, the first being motion detection and tracking based on camera switching, and the second being, face detection and recognition. 
Motion detection has been achieved using Motion Templates. Using this algorithm, the direction of motion is determined. Based on this, camera switching based tracking has 
been implemented. Face detection has been implemented using Haar cascade features and Face recognition has been implemented using Eigen faces. 
This model of surveillance is called “Intelligent Collaborative Surveillance”, as multiple cameras work in collaborative manner, and creates an intelligent surveillance technology 
which is more reliable against attacks, cost less overall, need less energy to run and provides much more analytics leading to less dependency on human.
